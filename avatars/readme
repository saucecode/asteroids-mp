This is the avatars folder!
All the custom avatars of people you play with will be downloaded here.

spaceship.png is the default/placeholder texture for all spaceships (if they do not have textures, or their textures are still being loaded).

custom.png is the avatar that will be sent to the server, and will be how other players see you. Feel free to edit it into wacky crazy things.
NOTE: By default custom.png does not exist. spaceship.png will be used until you create custom.png in this folder.

custom.png should always be a png image. Recommended to be size 32x32. Transparency is supported and encouraged.
