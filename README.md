asteroids-mp
=========

an asteroids-like multiplayer game written in Java with LWJGL 2.9.1 for drawing and KryoNet 2.18 for networking.
The goal of the game (currently) is to use your ship's thrust to accelerate asteroids into other players.

Other game modes could potentially be implemented.

Depends on kryonet-2.18-all.jar, lwjgl_util.jar, lwjgl.jar.
